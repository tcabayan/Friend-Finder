# Friend-Finder
A Compatability Based Application Using Node and Express Server

**Overview**
In this activity, I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from a users' surveys then compares their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
Express was used to handle routing. I used Heroku to deploy the app≥÷l;op7
